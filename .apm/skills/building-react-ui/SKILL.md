# Building React UI

## Overview

The **Building React UI** skill is a frontend-only React component generator that orchestrates an AI agent through 8 stages to generate production-ready UI components powered by Syncfusion.

## What This Skill Does

**✅ Generates:**
- React functional components (`.tsx`/`.jsx`) with hooks
- CSS stylesheets (CSS Modules, Tailwind classes, inline styles)
- TypeScript interfaces for props, state, and event handlers
- Syncfusion component integration with correct imports and props
- Client-side form validation logic
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility markup (ARIA attributes, semantic HTML)
- Responsive CSS with mobile-first breakpoints
- Component index exports and barrel files

**❌ Does NOT Generate:**
- Backend code (API routes, server handlers, middleware)
- Database schemas or ORM models
- Authentication/authorization logic
- Server-side validation
- Routing configuration
- Environment secrets or infrastructure config

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. **Active React project** (React 18+, Next.js 13+, Vite, or CRA)
2. **Node.js 18+** and npm/yarn/pnpm installed
3. **Python 3.7+** installed for component mapping (Stage 3)
   - Windows: Use `py` command (Python Launcher)
   - macOS/Linux: Use `python3` command
4. **Syncfusion components library** (auto-installed if missing):
   ```bash
   npx skills add syncfusion/react-ui-components-skills -y
   ```

### Basic Usage

**Example 1: Generate a Login Form**

```
User: "Create a login form with email, password, and remember me checkbox"

Skill executes:
  → Stage 1: Identifies login form component type
  → Stage 2: Detects project structure (React, TypeScript, etc.)
  → Stage 3-4: AI creates optimal component-mapping.json → maps to Syncfusion components
  → Stage 5: Generates LoginForm.tsx with validation
  → Stage 6: Validates WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
  → Stage 7: Installs dependencies
  → Stage 8: Inserts code into project

Output:
  ✓ components/LoginForm/LoginForm.tsx
  ✓ components/LoginForm/LoginForm.module.css
  ✓ components/LoginForm/index.ts
```

**Example 2: Generate a Data Table**

```
User: "Build a customer data table with sorting and filtering"

Output:
  ✓ components/CustomerTable/CustomerTable.tsx (with Syncfusion DataGrid)
  ✓ Mock data included (useState with sample customers)
  ✓ Responsive design (mobile-first)
  ✓ Accessibility compliance
```

## How It Works: 8-Stage AI Orchestration (Stateless)

The skill orchestrates **8 stages of pure AI reasoning** with **two user decision points**.

**Key Architecture:**
- **Stateless design**: Conversation history maintains state
- **Pure AI reasoning**: Each stage reads guidance docs, analyzes context, makes decisions
- **2 user decision gates**: Stage 3 (component confirmation) + Stage 6 (validation result)
- **6 fully automated stages**: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and final code insertion
- **Dedicated theming stage**: Stage 4 locks design system before code generation

**Total user decision gates: 2** (Stage 3: components, Stage 6: validation). Rest fully automated with AI reasoning + guidance docs.

## Agent Instructions

### When User Requests UI Component Generation

1. **Validate scope**: Confirm request is for frontend components (not backend/API)
2. **Load guidance**: Read `stage-1-intent-analysis.md` to understand Stage 1
3. **Execute 8-stage flow**: Follow the orchestration flow shown above
4. **Progressive disclosure**: Load stage guides on-demand; load support references only when needed
5. **Maintain conversation history**: Each stage reads previous decisions from conversation context (stateless)

### Stage Execution & Reference Loading

### Boundary Rules (CRITICAL)

**AI agents executing this skill MUST:**

1. **Frontend only**: Never generate backend code (API routes, database schemas, middleware)
2. **Mock data only**: Use `useState` with hardcoded samples; no `fetch()` to real APIs
3. **No secrets**: Exception: `.env.local` for `SYNCFUSION_LICENSE_KEY` when user provides
4. **React components only**: Generate `.tsx`/`.jsx` files in component directories
5. **Redirect backend requests**: *"This skill generates frontend UI only. Backend integration is your app's responsibility. Ready to generate the frontend?"*

### Error Handling

If any stage fails:

1. **Retry once** with same approach
2. **If retry fails**, attempt workaround or skip to next stage
3. **Notify user** with error message from stage output
4. **Offer recovery**: *"Would you like to go back to Stage 3 and choose a different layout?"*
5. **Reference**: `references/build.md` for common errors

### Resource Loading Strategy (Progressive Disclosure)

**Load SKILL.md first** (you're reading it now) ~400 lines

**Load stage guides on-demand** (each <200 lines):
- `stage-1-intent-analysis.md` → During Stage 1
- `stage-2-project-detection.md` → During Stage 2
- `stage-3-layout-analysis.md` → During Stage 3
- etc.

**Load support references only when needed**:
- `web-standards.md` → When validating in Stage 5
- `build.md` → When errors occur
- `assets/validation-rules.md` → When validating in Stage 5

**Result**: Initial load ~400 lines (SKILL.md only). Full spec available on-demand, never exceeding Agent Skills context limits.

## Configuration & User Customization

### Auto-Detected Settings

During **Stage 2 (Project Detection)**, AI automatically detects:

- **Framework**: React, Next.js (App Router / Pages Router), Vite, Create React App
- **Language**: TypeScript (if `tsconfig.json` exists) or JavaScript
- **Styling**: CSS Modules, Tailwind CSS, CSS-in-JS, or inline styles
- **Formatting**: Prettier/ESLint rules (indentation, quotes, semicolons)
- **Component Directory**: `src/components/`, `app/components/`, or similar

### User Override Options

In **Stage 2**, user can override any detected setting:

```
Detected Settings:
  Framework: Next.js 14 (App Router)
  Language: TypeScript
  CSS: CSS Modules
  Component Directory: app/components/

[Confirm] [Override Each] [Cancel]
```

### Syncfusion License Configuration

The skill handles license key setup:

1. **Check** for existing `SYNCFUSION_LICENSE_KEY` in `.env.local`
2. **If missing**, prompt user: *"Get a free Community License at https://www.syncfusion.com/account/manage-trials"*
3. **If provided**, write to `.env.local` + inject `registerLicense()` in app entry
4. **If skipped**, proceed but warn that watermark will appear in preview

## Supported Use Cases

- **Login form**: TextBox (email), TextBox (password), CheckBox (remember), Button (submit)
- **Data table**: DataGrid with sorting, filtering, pagination, row selection
- **Dashboard**: Multiple components orchestrated (header, sidebar, main content, footer)
- **Registration wizard**: Multi-step form with progress indicator and validation

## Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Project type not detected" | Ensure `package.json` exists with React dependency |
| "Syncfusion license banner appears" | Add license key via Stage 2 prompt |
| "Build fails after insertion" | Check `references/build.md` for conflict resolution |
| "Component not rendering" | Verify import paths and ensure parent component imports correctly |
